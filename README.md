## Sound2Light

### Linear Bar of Lights / Channel Range

**Goal:** Visualize the volume of the bass frequencies by lighting up one or more lights in a row.

**Notes:** The channels don't have to be consecutive. To light up multiple rows in parallel use the "Join Rows" block as shown in this example. Change the pattern style to "Dot" to only light up one light at the end of the bar.
